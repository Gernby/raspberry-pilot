  "_reactCenter0-2": "This is to reduce oscillation in a straight line by advancing the desired angle further into the future ONLY when going straight",
  "_advanceSteer_note": "This is the amount of increase or decrease from 1.0 for steering angle adjustment.  (-0.05 --> 0.95 * angle)",
  "_angleFactor_note": "Similar to advanceSteer, but is 'hidden' from the model.  Basically, the steering angle input is divided by the value, and the output is multiplied by it.",
  "_reactMPC_note": "This is the amount of seconds into the future that the desired angle will be projected.  This is used to account for delay in the steering control commands and for the delay caused by smoothing",
  "_dampMPC_note": "This is the amount of seconds into the future that the desired angle will be smoothed.  Smaller value results in more steering response AND more steering noise",
  "_reactSteer_note": "This is the additional time (added to dampSteer) that the EPS steering rate will be projected into the _future_.  Increasing this value will prevent overshooting the desired angle.",
  "_dampSteer_note": "This is the amount of seconds into the past that the actual angle will be smoothed.  Smaller value results in more noise, but LESS response.",
  "_discreteAngle": "This is an option to use EITHER the discrete desired angle from the model OR the relative desired angle (ie. '5.2 degrees' vs 'move 0.1 degree to the left')",
  "_polyDamp_note": "This is the amount of seconds into the future that the projected lane error will be smoothed.  Smaller value increases response to lane centering AND increases noise",
  "_polyFactor_note": "This is the **multiplier** that converts projected lane error into a steering angle adjustment.  Smaller values result in less centering effort, Larger values can cause increasing oscillation.",
  "_polyReact_note": "This is the ratio of desired angle that comes from ** the Fast Angle and Slow Angle outputs of the model**.  At 0.0, the average of Slow and Fast is used, -0.5 will use ONLY Slow Angle, and +0.5 will use ONLY Fast Angle.",
  "_useMinimize_note": "This is an option (1 or 0) to consider the noise level from left and right in the blending of the lane center values.",
